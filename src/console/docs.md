## Welcome!

Welcome to the exciting world of 
__"Peter the Robot's Clean-Up Adventure"!__
In this fun and engaging game, you'll meet 
Peter, a friendly robot with a 
big task ahead of him. Peter's hangar is filled 
with a __jumble of boxes and junk__, and he needs 
your help to tidy it up!
<br><br>
Peter wants to scatter the boxes around the hangar 
to collect all the rubbish. To lend Peter a hand, 
you'll write __a simple program__ to guide him. 
Don't worry, thoughâ€”it's easy! The programming 
language Peter uses has just __6 simple commands__.
<br><br>
Are you ready to help Peter turn his messy hangar 
into a sparkling clean space? Let's get started 
and have a blast coding together!
<br><br>

## Instructions:

There are currently __6 minimal instructions__
implemented in the language:
<br><br>

1. **_Move_**: robot makes _n_ steps forward
```instructions
move ${n} steps
```

2. **_Turn_**: robot turns either __right__ or __left__
```instructions
turn ${right | left}
```

3. **_Repeat_**: robot repeats _n_ times some
particular block of instructions
```instructions
repeat ${n} times
  ${block}
end
```

4. **_Define_**: define custom procedure
```instructions
define ${body} as
  ${body}
end
```

5. **_Execute_**: execute custom procedure
```
execute ${procedure_name}
```

6. **_Backtracking_**: robot returns to the
initial position (before the _backtracking_) automatically
```
backtracking
  ${body}
end
```
<br>

Additionally, you can leave comments
in your code. Comments start with symbol __'#'__:
```instructions
# This is a comment
# This is another comment
```
<br>

Sample program:
```instructions
define Square as
  repeat 4 times
    move 5 steps
    turn right
  end
end

backtracking
  execute Square
end

move 6 steps
execute Square
```
